Last night at 8:30, as the sun was going down, a large, bowl-like shape appeared over our hedge, traveling east at about the speed of a plane. It seemed to be surrounded by fog even thought the sky was clear that night. Behind the light-colored ""bowl"" trailed a wide, white plume that varied in width - not a straight, thin line like a meteor and not symmetrical. As the bowl got harder to see in the distance, the white plume remained in the sky quite a bit longer."

Something moving caught my eye to my left and when I looked up at the sky I saw a round ball traveling south at a fast rate of speed. It looked like an orb that I have seen on many UFO documentaries. The object left a thin white vapor trail and there was a haze around the orb, the center was solid. It then made a turn towards the left and disappeared into a clear sky. It was like it went into a hole. There was no background except for the moon estimated to be about 20 feet higher than the object. The sky was clear."

I went outside to feed my dog and I looked up to see first two objects moving around in the night sky. So started to film them moving around. They were moving in all directions. I called my husband and kids out to witness it which they did. From what looked like a metal object it would change into a round ball of light and then back again. My husband got his laser out and started to point at one who then proceeded to play with the laser and move in incredible speed. This one was followed by a smaller craft."

On Saturday evening around 8 pm on April 29, 2023, my son and I were working in his yard on landscape lights when I happened to look up at a distant mass of what looked like a galaxy glowing slowly moving towards us from about 30 degrees above the horizon. My first reaction was to point and say to him ""What the F*&^ is that?"" He then replied ""Holy shit. What is that?"" I then said grab you phone and start taking pictures. I then ran inside the home to grab mine. It was difficult getting focus. I considered calling 911. At one point I asked him to get a cell phone tripod out of my car (actually asking him to get the tripod out of the trunk of my ""camera"" which was of course a mistake with the excitement) and when he returned I was trying to get my phone set up on it but could not. So I laid down on my back trying to keep the camera steady while filming. We had plenty of time. As they were directly overhead, most seemed to be in a steady movement but others were moving around. Some rapidly. And from that distance it had to be incredible fast. We stopped taking any video or photos and just observed. Until they faded at about 30 degrees from the horizon like traveling in a straight line. Not following the curvature of the earth like Starlink for example. I contacted the local news and sent them photos but never heard back and could not find anything online of other people reporting anything. This was nothing like Starlink. I witnessed Starlink with my son and his wife on the evening of May 4th. And have video and photos. This was completely different. These objects were moving around independently and spreading out in various ways. Maybe as far as 20 miles at one point. I am a 61 year old US Marine Corp Vet and my son is 30. We have zero interest in personal attention. But I know what I witnessed was unlike anything I have ever seen."

I was outside with my daughter, I happened to glance up at the sky, staring toward the east I noticed briefly a bright orange circular light, fade away in the same location it didn’t move it just faded out. It was larger than I have seen the moon most days. I told my daughter, who was standing next to me at the time, what I saw ,but she didn’t notice it when I asked her."

The object was heading east approximately 300 feet from ground,( from where I saw it). It had a orangeish tail for awhile.. As it got further away the tail got lighter in color, almost white), and the farther it got the less I saw a tail trail. Eventually it was to far for us to see it."
